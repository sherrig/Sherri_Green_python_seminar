# Read the output file obtained after running group_9.py
# and plot the paricle's trajectory.
# Note:
# The visualization is not elegant if the initial component
# of the velocity parallel to the B-fields is larger than the
# component perpendicular to the B-field. why??

## DRAWING EXTRA FEATURES (you can skip this)

# 1. Draw a reference xz-plane with the size determined by the diameter of the helix

pos_a = np.array(pos)                  #convert the position list to a numpy array
xmax, ymax, zmax = pos_a.max(axis = 0)     # to use numpy max and min functions to find 
xmin, ymin, zmin = pos_a.min(axis = 0)     # the corners of the box 

center = vector((xmax + xmin) / 2., pos[0][1] , (zmax + zmin) / 2.)   #center of the helix

box(pos = center, length = 2 * (xmax - xmin), width = 2 * (zmax - zmin),
    height = 0.05, color = color.blue, opacity = 0.2)




# 2. Draw the (x,y,z) - at the center of the helix

l = [xmax - xmin, zmax - zmin]       # length introduced to scale vectors

print "max", xmax, ymax, zmax
print "min", xmin, ymin, zmin
print "center", center
print "initial postion", pos[0]

# Draw the  Magnetic field  at the center of the helice

if ymax < xmax:
    b = max(l)
if ymax > xmax:
    b = ymax

B = arrow(pos = center + vector(0, -b / 2, 0), axis = vector(0, b, 0), shaftwidth = 0.2,
          headwidth = .8, color = color.blue, opacity = 0.7)
label(pos = center + vector(0, b / 2, 0), opacity = 0, color = color.blue, height = 16, xoffset = 4, line = False, box = False,  text = 'B')

# If you want a bunch of B-field vectors inside the helix try this:

#j = mag(center) / 3
#for i in range(9):    # 9 vectors in a circle at 1/3 from the center of the helix
#    r_B = vector(j * cos(i * pi/4), -b/2, j * sin(i * pi/4)) + center  #points in a circle of radius 1 centered at the center of the helix
#    arrow(pos = r_B, axis = vector(0,b/2,0), shaftwidth = 0.2, color = color.blue, opacity = 0.7)     #unit vectors


# Draw the initial velocity at the initial position

startVel = arrow(pos = vector(pos[0][0], pos[0][1], pos[0][2]), axis = vector(vel[0]), shaftwidth = .3, color = color.green)
label(pos = startVel.pos + vector(0,0,0), yoffset = 6, color = color.green, line = True, box = False,  text = 'Vo', opacity = 0)



#### You want to do this
# Draw the particle's path using the curve( ) object

path = curve( color = color.cyan, radius = 0.1)   # define the particle's path

n=0
while n < len(pos) - 1:
        rate(100)# this line slows down to 100 updates per second and allows to see the animation
        path.append( pos = vector(pos[n]) )  # add points to the curve
        n = n + 1



particle = sphere(pos = vector(pos[len(pos) - 1]), radius = 0.3, color = color.red)  #add the moving particle
